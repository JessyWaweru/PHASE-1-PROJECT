            <p id="prologue">A short story is regarded as a work of fiction that is categorized by its length.But now ,
                we take an effort to change that narrative;
                to make it something else;you,me and our experiences.We now provoke our minds to remember short stories from past experiences.
                Together.Are you ready to share your stories to the world?
